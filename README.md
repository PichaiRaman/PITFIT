# PITFIT
Repository to store code for creating PITFIT (PIpeline To FInd Targets) Application. This application is meant to perform a few different things. 

1. We can identify putative targets for targeted therapies / Immunotherapies in a knowledge-driven manner. 
2. Using a variety of data sources annotate and describe targets coming out of the pipeline
3. Offer ways to therapeutically intervene and suggest clinical trials
